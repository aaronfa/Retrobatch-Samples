# Retrobatch JavaScript API

As part of Retrobatch Pro 1.2, you can now write custom nodes using JavaScript and the Cocoa frameworks from Apple. This feature is considered a beta, and we're looking to collect feedback and ideas for it. If you run into problems or want to give feedback, make a [post on our forum](http://forums.flyingmeat.com/c/retrobatch) or send use an email: [support@flyingmeat.com](mailto:support@flyingmeat.com).

### Warning

While 3rd party plug-in can be extremely useful, they can also be dangerous to your computer and files. Plug-ins have the ability to read, write, and even delete files on your computer. Plug-ins available from our [samples page](https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/jsplugin/) have been reviewed and are considered safe to use. The same can not be said for any plug-in downloaded from other locations on the Internet or linked to from our forums.

### Sample Plug-Ins

You can download a number of [sample plug-ins from our website](https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/jsplugin/). The source for these plug-ins are also [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ccgus/Retrobatch-Samples/tree/master/plugin).

### Installing Plug-Ins

Installing a plug-in is easy. Simply download a plug-in, unzip it as necessary, and double click the File.retrobatchplugin. Retrobatch will then offer to install the plug-in for you.
